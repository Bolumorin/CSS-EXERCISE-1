          My name is <b>Boluwatife Somorin D.</b> As humans, we all want to be
          able to do our tasks faster and easier without going through too much
          physical stress; Technology has come into place to help humans achieve
          what they want. My love for technology, in all spheres, is pretty on a
          high scale because it is <i>lucrative</i> and it has made what used to
          demand much physical strength, demand less.

          In lesson 6, we learnt about CSS(Cascading style sheet). We learnt how
          to <b> cascade</b> and how to use <b>specificity</b> in designing our
          written html code to build an attractive web page. We leanrt about
          terms like <i>inherit</i> ,<i>initial</i> ,<i>etc.</i> We also learnt
          about <b>The Box Model.</b> The box model talked about
          <b> <i>Margin</i> </b>, <b> <i>Padding</i> </b>,
          <b> <i>Border,</i> </b> etc. In CSS, we also learnt about other styles
          like <b>text-decoration</b>, <b> colors</b>, etc.

          When we discussed about <b>The Box Model</b>, we spoke about
          <b><i>Padding</i></b> , <b><i>Margin</i></b
          >, <b><i>Border</i></b
          >, etc. <b>Padding</b> refers to the space just immediately around the
          content; the space between the element content and the element.
          <b>Margin</b> refers to the space around all other elements.
          <b>Border</b> is used to give the edges of an elements more form and
          allows it to have further designs.
